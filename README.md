vim-papyrus - Syntax highlighting for the TES5 Papyrus language in Vim
======================================================================

A file type plugin for Vim that includes (currently rudimentary) syntax
highlighting for the Papyrus scripting language in TES5: Skyrim.

To use it, copy the ftdetect and syntax directories into your .vim or
\_vimfiles directory.

Further plans include error detection and papyrus compiler integration.
